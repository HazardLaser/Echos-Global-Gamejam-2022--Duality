# Echos Global Gamejam 2022, Duality 
 Echos is a two player platformer puzzle action game where one player plays as a mortal man and the other plays as a lost soul tethered to him. The game takes place in two side by side rooms, representing the living realm and spirit realm respectively. Each player interacts with the world differently using a unique skillset based on their character. Players can swap places at any time by initiating the same command. The goal of each level is to get to an exit point, which will require cooperation between the two using the tether (swap) mechanic. There is a narrative underlying the gameplay that will reveal information about the two characters and their mysterious connection as you play. 


There are two installation options. Either install through executable and follow instructions or through zip. It's the same game, just different installs.
